We can assign complex networks into four general classes (although there is some overlap between them):  technological networks (e.g., internet, the telephone network, power grids, transportation network),  information networks (e.g., the world wide web, citation networks),   biological networks (e.g., biochemical network, neutral networks, ecological networks), and  social networks. \r\n\r\nCharacterizing complex network's structure is a key to understand any unifying principles underlying their topology. Several previous works  have shown that many topological properties can vary for different types of system. However these works generally focus only a few characteristics at time.   In this project, we present the first part of a method to characterize complex networks by performing an extensive analysis of the global and local topological features of networks. In a  second part, these features  are used into input vectors for a SVN classifier, establishing an efficient way of learning the classification of complex networks. \r\n\r\n\r\nData\r\n-----\r\n\r\nTo use this software you can extract the data and calculate the features with: \r\nhttps://github.com/mariwahl/NetAna-Complex-Network-Analysis\r\n\r\nAnd cleanse the data with:\r\nhttps://github.com/mariwahl/NetClean-Complex-Networks-Data-Cleanser\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThe feature vectors were extracting using MNet:\r\nhttps://github.com/mariwahl/NetAna-Complex-Network-Analysis\r\n\r\nWe have vectors for different normalization (Snowball and Metropolis Hastings Random Walk samplings) for different sizes. We also have vectors for the entire graphs for some of the features (that were possible to be calculated).\r\n\r\nThese vectors are parsed and cleansed using:\r\nhttps://github.com/mariwahl/NetClean-Complex-Networks-Data-Cleanser\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature Section and Classifiers\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe perform classification of the network features using many classifiers:\r\n- SVM (supervisioned)\r\n- Logistic Regression (supervisioned)\r\n- Adaboost (supervisioned)\r\n- EM (unsupervisioned)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis and Plots\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThe comparisons of the the many classifiers and the plots are available under each classifier's folder.\r\n\r\n\r\n***** RESULTS ******\r\n====================\r\n\r\nWe obtain excellent results for our classifiers:\r\n\r\n1) SVM RESULTS, (train/test PERCENTAGE: 0.8)\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nlinear xmin,    atrain: 0.815,   atest: 0.809\r\n\r\nSVC xmin,       atrain: 0.734,   atest: 0.739\r\n\r\nlinear gauss,   atrain: 0.821,   atest: 0.816\r\n\r\nSVC gauss,      atrain: 0.916,   atest: 0.914\r\n\r\nlinear none,    atrain: 0.6,     atest: 0.611\r\n\r\nSVC none,       atrain: 0.998,   atest: 0.993  ---> ALMOST 100% ACCURARY!!!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) ADABOOST RESULTS, (train/test PERCENTAGE: 0.8)\r\n------------------------------------------------\r\ntech, xmin ,     atrain: 0.906114845197 , atest: 0.905554614733\r\n\r\ninfo, xmin ,     atrain: 0.961694628209 , atest: 0.95816045724\r\n\r\nsocial, xmin ,   atrain: 0.932485842816 , atest: 0.924731160034\r\n\r\nbio, xmin ,      atrain: 0.977130457793 , atest: 0.979229466554\r\n\r\ntech, gauss ,    atrain: 0.904228631913 , atest: 0.905944115157\r\n\r\ninfo, gauss ,    atrain: 0.959289229955 , atest: 0.955270956816\r\n\r\nsocial, gauss ,  atrain: 0.930746229161 , atest: 0.925279424217\r\n\r\nbio, gauss ,     atrain: 0.977036782218 , atest: 0.979362828112\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3) LOGISTIC REGRESSION, (train/test PERCENTAGE: 0.8)\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nxmin,     atrain: 0.821,   atest: 0.814\r\n\r\ngauss,    atrain: 0.827,   atest: 0.823   ---> 83% ACCURACY\r\n\r\nnone,     atrain: 0.745,   atest: 0.748\r\n\r\n\r\nFeature Pairwise:\r\n-----------------\r\nType   Siz   Ord   Ass   Tra   Deg   Cor   NTr   NCl   Cnu   Clu   Eco   Ecc   Dia   Bet   Den   Rad   Scl   Com   Pag   Cen \r\n\r\nxmin   0.145 0.545 1.0  0.34  0.845 0.585 0.655 0.0   0.32  1.0   0.0  0.505  0.465 0.715  0.97 0.54  0.45  0.0   1.0   1.0  \r\n\r\ngauss  0.155 0.52  1.0  0.365 0.785 0.605 0.585 0.0   0.415 1.0   0.0  0.51   0.48  0.7    0.96 0.57  0.41  0.0   1.0   1.0  \r\n\r\nnone   0.155 0.565 1.0  0.3   0.845 0.55  0.6   0.0   0.48  1.0   0.0  0.5    0.495 0.69   0.97 0.475 0.47  0.0   1.0   1.0   \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
