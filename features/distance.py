The geodesic distance between two nodes $u$ and $v$ is the length of the shortest path between them,

d(u,v) = \min distance (u,v)

When it increases logarithmically with size n of the network, it is called small-world property.

The average distance is:
\bar d(G) = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} d_i(u,v)
