'''
The degree of a node is defined as the number of its neighboring edges. It can be formally defined using the adjacency matrix:

deg(u) = \sum_{v \in V} a_{uv}

Average degree is the average value of the degree of all nodes in the graph. In real-world networks, it often follows a power law scale-free networks):

\bar{deg}(G)=\frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} deg(u_i)
