'''
Represents the number of shortest paths containing the link e. Links with high edgebetweeness centrality corresponds to bridge-like connectors between two parts of the network. We denote sigma_{uv}(e) as the number of shortest paths between u and v containing the link e: 

ebetw(e) = \sum_{u<v} \frac{\sigma_{vw} (e)}{\sigma_{vw}}.
