===========================================================

Description
-----------

Here analyse our nets using adaboost with decision stumps. We report the training and test errors.
Cross validation sets were for 300, 200, 100 and 50.

* Entire Nets folder:
Performed for the entire nets, with the features that were possible to be extracted from these large graphs, divided by cross-validation sets. From these results we can evaluate the vality of the chose division for networks (info, social, bio, and tech).

* Sampling Nets folder:
Perfomed for the sampled nets, divided by cross-validation sets. We test for all features (missing have 0 values) and for the 10 first features (that do not present missing values).
